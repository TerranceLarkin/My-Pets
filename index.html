<h1><strong>Rosie Siggy and Khai</strong></h1>

<body>
  <p>I have three of the best pets anyone could ask for. Roise, Siggy, and Khai are
    very loving and friendly, with great personalities. Rosie is the mother of the bunch
    at 12 years old; while Siggy and Khai are just a year old. These pets have captured
    the hearts of everyone that has come in contact with them.

  <p>Siggy and Khai are the babies of the family. We found Siggy outside of her temporary home and she followed us home. We reached out to the home owner and they informed us that we could have Siggy, but she had a sister and it was a packaged deal.

  <p>Rosie may be old in age, but she's young in spirit. She's a 12 year old beagel and she has been with us since 3 years old. She's loving and an big part of our family. She travels with us everywhere and all of our family and friends look forward to seeing her.
